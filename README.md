Machine Learning Algorithms Overview
Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It fits a linear equation to the observed data, aiming to minimize the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values. This method is ideal for predicting continuous outcomes, such as sales or prices.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by identifying the 'k' closest training samples to a given test instance, using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance). The prediction is made based on the majority class (for classification) or the average value (for regression) of these neighbors. KNN is effective for smaller datasets and is easy to implement.

Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a specific category by applying the logistic function, which outputs values between 0 and 1. This technique is particularly useful for predicting binary outcomes, such as whether a customer will buy a product or not.
